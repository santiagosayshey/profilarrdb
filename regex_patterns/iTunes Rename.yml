description: 'iTunes began offering video content in October 2005 with the release
  of iTunes 6. At launch, the iTunes Store provided popular TV shows from ABC, Disney
  Channel, and other networks. Users could purchase and view video content, such as
  episodes of Desperate Housewives, Lost, That''s So Raven, and The Suite Life of
  Zack & Cody.


  In 2008, Apple introduced "iTunes Digital Copy," a feature on select DVDs and Blu-ray
  discs that allowed users to obtain a digital copy of the video content in iTunes
  and associated media players.


  Over time, iTunes expanded its video offerings and became a significant platform
  for purchasing, organizing, and viewing movies and TV shows.'
