  - People are going to want to use this profile because size is _the_ most important\
  \ consideration. Quality and efficiency matter yes, but not if the file is too big.\n\
  - So, we use size to bucket the releases we want. If people want stuff that is between\
  \ 3-5gb per movie, then they are going to grab stuff that is 3-5gb per movie. \n\
  - The best thing you can possibly do - is pick the most efficient possible release\
  \ in the size range a person wants. \n- Once we sort into size groups what do we\
  \ actually want? In what order? \n\n1. DS4K x265 Encode\n2. Bluray x265 Encode\n\
  3. Lossless h265 WEB-DL (HONE does this, who else?)\n4. 1080p Quality Fallback\n\
  5. Crap x265 (MeGusta, iVy, etc) \n\n- Profilarr advanced mode\n- Instead of showing\
  \ generic scoring page, let users click advanced mode. Set a target size (per gb\
  \ or something), then apply scores on top of that\n- Import options. Profilarr tagged\
  \ stuff inside radarr/sonarr will let profilarr apply a profile to that item. Profilarr\
  \ can then choose the specific size settings depending on the movie (get the runtime\
  \ from the arr, import the specific profile appropriate for that movie. 1hr, 2hr,\
  \ 3hr, animation, etc) \n- size CFs are built at compile time, not hardcoded. \n\
  \nAt the top end, how do we decide what to grab? size above all? release group above\
  \ all? \n- Does it matter if a Timedistortion encode is \"better\" by whatever subjective\
  \ metric we use if its 2gb bigger than an EDGE2020 encode? I think no, the size\
  \ is more important to people. \n- Why should the \"better\" group win out here?\
  \ What exactly are they doing better? So long as we are encoding from a good source\
  \ (which we will blacklist groups who don't), then the quality benefits from 1-2gb\
  \ extra is not going to be evident for the majority of users. \n- What extra benefits\
  \ are they getting with the extra 1-2gb quality wise? Slightly better grain, dark\
  \ scene improvements, less banding, etc. \n- If you truly want quality, then you\
  \ need to be using the quality profile. \n- Building on Seraphys' idea using release\
  \ group tiers as \"tiebreakers\", we can maintain a psuedo list of release groups\
  \ parsed and ranked using GPPi. This way in practical searching, groups are actually\
  \ grouped together and you rely less on your indexer availability. "
