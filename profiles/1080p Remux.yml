description: "1080p Remux utilizes **audio tags** to prioritise high quality lossless\
  \ copies of HD Blu-rays.\n\n- Unlike the encode profiles, which target releases\
  \ based on a release group metric, 1080p Remux avoids this to stop *circular downloads*\
  \ where no discernable upgrade is found. \n- Instead, audio metrics such TrueHD,\
  \ Atmos, DTS-X, etc are used to indicate when a remux should be upgraded.\n- This\
  \ also helps to grab non group tagged remuxes, which are fairly common on quite\
  \ a few trackers who often have the best remux available. \n- If no 1080p Remux\
  \ cannot be found, the profile falls back to **1080p WEB-DLs**.\n- If no 1080p release\
  \ can be found, the profile will fall back to SD releases - DVD remuxes  / encodes. "
