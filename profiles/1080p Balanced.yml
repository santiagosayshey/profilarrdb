name: 1080p Balanced
description: '1080p Balanced targets consistent & immutable 1080p **WEB-DLs** with
  fallback to transparent x264 encodes, prioritised using the **Golden Popcorn Performance
  Index**.


  - Special considerations are given to **Balanced** groups who prioritize **streaming
  optimisation** over quality, falling somewhere around a tier 2 WEB-DL. This includes
  groups like **BHDStudio** and **hallowed**.

  - If no 1080p release can be found, the profile will fall back to SD releases -
  DVD remuxes  / encodes. '
